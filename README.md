```lrc
[00:05.27] This is the purpose of changing
[00:07.36] Hydrogen into breathable oxygen
[00:09.55] And they're as necessary here
[00:11.51] As the air is on earth
[00:13.80] But I still say, "They're flowers"
[00:16.86] If you like
[00:19.31] Do you sell them?
[00:22.09] I'm afraid not
[00:23.89] But maybe we can make a deal
